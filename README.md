# US Accidents Exploration withÂ Python
## A look into the number of accidents in the US from 2016 to 2019


This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientist for Enterprise nanodegree. The goal of the project is to find a dataset, come up with three questions to answer from it using Python, then writing a post on Medium to explain the findings.

The project has to follow the CRISP-DM industry standards for data science:



The dataset used can be found on Kaggle and the finding on Medium.
