# US Accidents Exploration with Python
## A look into the number of accidents in the US from 2016 to 2019


This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientist for Enterprise nanodegree. The goal of the project is to find a dataset, come up with three questions to answer from it using Python, then writing a post on Medium to explain the findings.

The project has to follow the CRISP-DM industry standards for data science:

* Business Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Prepare Data
* Model Data
* Result
* Deploy

The questions I will tackle using this methodology are:

* What states have the highest number of accidents?
* What's the trend of the number of accidents and is there any seasonality?
* What impacts the number of accidents in the US?

The dataset used can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents/data) and the finding on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sd.chaouki/us-car-accidents-exploration-with-python-e0dd4d458a3d).


## Getting Started

### Requirement

* Python 3
* Scikit-Learn
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Statsmodels
* Seaborn
* Plotly

### Notebook & Data

The dataset is a csv file called *US_Accidents_Dec19.csv*. All the code is in the *CRISP-DM Project.ipynb* Jupyter notebook.
